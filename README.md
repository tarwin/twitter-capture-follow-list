# twitter-capture-follow-list
Using the browser capture details from follow lists ie followers, following.

It's not perfect, sometimes doesn't get 100%. But could be useful. Works in Chrome.

It converts annoying Twitter images of Emojis into real unicode characters too! (I think)

## Instructions

- Go to a page such as your followers or following list. Make sure you are at the top of the page.
- Copy/paste the code from `capture-follow-list.js` into the browser console and press enter.
- Wait for it to complete. Once complete you will get `window.CAPTURED_PROFILE`. To easily copy enter `copy(window.CAPTURED_PROFILE)` in console and press enter.
